# OSM Bright styles
## Introduction
This repository contains GeoServer CSS styles to replicate a OSM-bright style.
Along with it we have a configuration file for ImpOSM3 and the layout of the target
layer group.

We hope to turn this into a stand-alone, usable data directory soon, but this should
get you started.
